# Compositing
Skia compositing sample

# Compilation

Open src/Compositing.dproj in Delphi and run the thing.

# Notes
This project outputs to the repo root to make media location simple

To break project (for @lmbelo illustrating skia.dll load issue as per https://github.com/skia4delphi/skia4delphi/issues/130) compile in Delphi, run and exit Delphi. Now navigate to repo root, delete skia.dll and run Compositing.exe. Sad, eh?
